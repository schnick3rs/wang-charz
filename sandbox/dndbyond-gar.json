        "description": "<p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric&mdash;performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</p>\r\n<p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gods of the Multiverse</a> section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Insight, Religion</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Equipment:</strong> A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp</dt>\r\n</dl>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: SHELTER OF THE FAITHFUL</strong></p>\r\n<p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\r\n<p>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.</p>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d8</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person&rsquo;s deeds and example.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>I see omens in every event and action.

If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span>you put it on).</span></p>\r\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart &mdash; in a chaste sort of devotion.

These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\r\n<p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing.

Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies<span>, </span><span>or hirelings.</span></p>\r\n<p>Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the g<span>uild&rsquo;s coffers.</span></p>\r\n<p>You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild.

You don&rsquo;t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop.
